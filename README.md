The minimum requirement is to have an ARM+DSP+NEON optimized implementation of the Mean-Shift Algorithm, which runs at least 4x faster than the baseline version (the start and stop timers are marked in the main.cpp). Baseline version is the solution running on ARM alone with -O3 optimization level. The speedup is calculated as follows:  Speedup = (Execution Time Baseline) / (Execution Time Optimized)
